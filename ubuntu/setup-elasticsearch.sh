# because this (20160205/thisisaaronland)
#
# A: I have an elasticsearch question: do you have an opinion about whether there any practical benefit in running it with the oracle
# java8 stuff or is the openjdk7 stuff just fine?
# A: I ask only because the former makes installs/build fiddly because of that stupid license modal dialog
# B: i always run with oracle java
# B: I have first hand experience of openjdk sucking
# B: at least with ES
# A: what was the suckage?
# B: this was some time ago. that said, all our ES installs (and java installs) done with chef obviate any problem with the dialog issue
# B: basically it would fail during indexing with openjdk for what we were working on at the time
# B: but chugged through without incident with oracle
