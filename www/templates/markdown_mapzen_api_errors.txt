## Error codes

In addition to any already [assigned HTTP status codes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) The Who's On First API defines the following additional status codes for representing errors or a failure scenario, across all API methods:

{foreach from=$errors item="row" key="code"}
* `{$code|@escape}` &#8212;  {$row.message|@escape}
{/foreach}

Individual API methods may define their own status codes within the `432-449` and `513-599` range on a per-method basis. Status codes in this range _may_ be used with different meanings by different API methods and it is left to API consumers to account for those differences.

The status codes defined above (`450`, `452-499`, and `512`) are unique and common to all API methods.
